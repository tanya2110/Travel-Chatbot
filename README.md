A chatbot written in es6 and vs6 for twilio and testing on the web. The important files are index.js and game.js.

First, you need to clone or download the repository in your local system if you're accessing it using GitHub.

License
I have used MIT license because it is a great choice as it allows you to share your code under a copyleft license without forcing others to expose their proprietary code, it√≠s business friendly and open source friendly while still allowing for monetization
